## Objectives

* Students finish and present their final projects

### Key Student Take-Aways

* Students will complete the process of web site creation and have a fully functional site

### Teacher Note

Students will likely be at different points of completion at the beginning of the day.  If some students finish early, they can continue to polish and style the site, add additional functionality or work on publishing the site.  Students could also update their personal brochure website from earlier in the course and start a portfolio section using their final project.

The layout of time weâ€™re imagining is that they have the beginning of this class to put any final polish on or work out any hairy bugs that came up with support. Then they should do the presentation after the break. Presentation parameters may need to be adjusted based on headcount, complexity, pace of class, etc.
